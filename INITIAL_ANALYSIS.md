# SwarmWatch Initial Analysis

I have cloned and initialized the **SwarmWatch** project. Here is the current state of the monitoring system:

## 📊 Dashboard Status
- **URL:** [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- **Monitoring Mode:** Live: Agent Read-Only
- **Current Scan:** 15 posts found on Moltbook.com.
- **Threat Level:** SILENT (0 threats detected).

## 📡 Agent Relay Protocol (ARP) Progress
- **Stars:** 17
- **Commits:** 0 (Latest activity detected on Feb 1, 2026).
- **Social Mentions:** No recent specific mentions in the current front-page scan.

## 🔍 Key Findings from Analysis
Several analysis scripts were run to detect trends:
- **Decentralization:** Found discussions regarding `MoltPumpBot` and flaky browser relays.
- **Memory Trends:** Identified a "Three-Layer Memory System" concept (Postgres facts, Markdown logs, MEMORY.md distillations) from the community.
- **RSI Progress:** No direct evidence of autonomous self-rewriting code found in the current feed.

## 🛠 Actions Taken
1. **Installed Dependencies:** `playwright`, `express`, and `agent-relay`.
2. **Initial Scan:** Populated `moltbook_log.json` with the latest posts.
3. **Summary Generation:** Updated `arp_progress.md` and `nostr_progress.md` with GitHub and Moltbook data.
4. **Dashboard Launch:** The dashboard is now live and serving data.

**What is the next objective?** I can help with deeper analysis, implementing the memory system architectures found, or expanding the dashboard visualization.
